Analysis-StackExchange
======================

This is all the python code you would need to mine the complete StackExchange dump. The data used is  all the stackexchange data till September, 2011, released under a creative-commons license. I used this for a course project that is not even remotely commercial. 

You can download the data over Http, which is what I did, or you can use torrents. The data is quite large in size, I am uploading the smallest XML files for you to get started while your data gets downloaded ;) 

StackExchange Story
==================

The data is in the form of big XML files. Some questions you can answer

1. how many users
2. badges distribution
3. how many producers/consumers
4. popular tags

and so on. 

There was a slightly higher purpose of doing this project. I wanted to find out the kind of patterns that are visible in contributions. But, those details can be found in the blog posts  here : http://www.rohitdholakia.com/blog/categories/stackoverflow/
